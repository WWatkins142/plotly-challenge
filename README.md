## Belly Button Biodiversity

This assignment explores the [Belly Button Biodiversity dataset]( http://robdunnlab.com/projects/belly-button-biodiversity/) with an [interactive dashboard](https://wwatkins142.github.io/plotly-challenge/)  that catalogs the microbies found on human navels. The dataset reveals that a small handful of microbial species (also called operational taxonomic units, or OTUs, in the study) were present in more than 70% of people, while the rest were relatively rare.

### Plotly
- D3 libary used to read in samples.json
- Created horizontal barchart with dropdown menu to display the top 10 OTUs found per study participant
- Created a bubble chart to diplay each sample
- Displayed Test Subject demographic information
- All plots update any time a new Test Subject ID is selected.
